{{<objectives chapter="2">}}

Our goal for this chapter is to develop confidence about basic functions 
and variables in Rust.

All of our project's source files live in the `src` directory, and for the
purposes of clarity, we're only going to use the `main.rs` file for our 
markdown compiler.

The Hello World example code provided gives us all we need to know to start
customizing our project. By the end of this chapter, executing our code without
arguments will output a banner--a short block of text that includes the 
program's name, the author, a brief description, and usage examples.
