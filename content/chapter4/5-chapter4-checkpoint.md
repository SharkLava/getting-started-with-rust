In this chapter, we learned about how a markdown compiler works, and we started 
working more closely with strings and string slices while piecing together 
functionality with conditional logic.

Next, we'll implement our Markdown compiler logic and open a file, read it 
line-by-line, translate it into HTML, and write the HTML to a new file. 

It's going to be fun!
