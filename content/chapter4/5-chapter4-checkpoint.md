In this chapter, we developed confidence in our ability to describe how a Markdown 
compiler works, and learned how to instantiate a vector by reading and parsing 
command-line arguments in Rust. We also got a little familiar with `match`, and 
passing an argument to a function. In the next chapter, we are going to implement 
our Markdown compiler logic and open a file, read it line-by-line, translate it 
into HTML, and write the HTML to a new file. It's going to be fun!
