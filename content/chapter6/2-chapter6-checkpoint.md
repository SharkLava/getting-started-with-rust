Congratulations! 

You've created a working CLI tool that converts Markdown to HTML, and you 
wrote it all yourself. I'm proud of you!

I hope that this experience has helped you build confidence with Rust so that you

**Looking for what to work on next?** Consider trying one of the [challenges]({{< relref "3-where-next.md" >}})!
