Congratulations! 

You've created a working CLI tool that converts Markdown to HTML, and you 
wrote it all yourself.

If you made it this far, I want you to know that I am very proud of all the work 
you have done here. I hope that this experience has helped you build confidence 
with Rust so that you are well-equipped mentally and emotionally to start 
tackling some of the more difficult aspects of this really fun and unique 
language.

**Looking for what to work on next?** Consider trying one of the [challenges]({{< relref "3-where-next.md" >}})!
