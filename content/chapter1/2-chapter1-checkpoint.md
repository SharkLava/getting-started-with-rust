    objectives:
    - Create a new Rust project on the command line without errors 
    - Compile and build a simple "Hello, World" Rust project without errors

Let's recap:

* Create a new Rust project with `cargo new --bin my-neat-cli`
* Build and run your project with `cargo run`

In the next section, we'll dive into the Rust language and start customizing 
our markdown compiler to make it feel like an actual program.
