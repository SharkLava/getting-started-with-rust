In this chapter, we fleshed out the meat and potatoes (or tofu and beans) of our 
Markdown compiler. We developed confidence in opening a file, reading and 
parsing that file one line at a time, then writing to a file. We also took a 
deep dive into the basics of logical thinking for a very simple compiler. Now 
that the tool is finished, it's time to use Cargo to build a release version 
of tinymd--which we are going to do in the next and final chapter of this 
tutorial.
