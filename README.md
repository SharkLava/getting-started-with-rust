_**June 2022 Update**: I'm revamping and updating this book for 2022. Take a look at the `spring-cleaning` branch for a preview of what I've been working on. I'm hoping to have this done by mid-summer._

## Summary of Custom Content

There are some special Hugo shortcodes I use in my tutorials. 

* **codecaption**. This creates a custom code block with line numbers and a filename at the top (corresponding to the `title` field). 
* **checkpoint**. This is used to display the student learning objectives (SLOs) of each chapter, along with a link to a Gist and 
  an quote about perserverence.
* **showobjectives**. Lists the objectives of a particular chapter. 

In addition to this, there are some other uses of Hugo shortcodes, like `relref` and whatnot. 

Thanks again for contributing!
