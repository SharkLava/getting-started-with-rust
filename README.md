I appreciate your pull requests to help make this tutorial better! 

**March 2022 Update** Slowly but surely I'll be migrating my tutorials over to a system where merged PRs will be automatically deployed to production. In the meantime, I'm still accepting PRs into this one and will continue to manually update as needed. Thank you!

## Summary of Custom Content

There are some special Hugo shortcodes I use in my tutorials. 

* **codecaption**. This creates a custom code block with line numbers and a filename at the top (corresponding to the `title` field). 
* **checkpoint**. This is used to display the student learning objectives (SLOs) of each chapter, along with a link to a Gist and 
  an quote about perserverence.
* **showobjectives**. Lists the objectives of a particular chapter. 

In addition to this, there are some other uses of Hugo shortcodes, like `relref` and whatnot. 

Thanks again for contributing!
